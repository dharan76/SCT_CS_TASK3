🔐 Password Strength Checker
This script evaluates the strength of a user-provided password based on common best practices for secure passwords. It uses regular expressions to check for specific character requirements and provides both a strength rating and feedback on how to improve the password.

📋 Features
Checks password against five key criteria:

Minimum length (at least 8 characters)

At least one uppercase letter

At least one lowercase letter

At least one digit

At least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*(), etc.)

Provides a score (0–5) and corresponding strength level:

🔴 Weak (0–2)

🟠 Medium (3)

🟡 Strong (4)

🟢 Very Strong (5)

1. How to Use Regular Expressions (Regex)
You practiced using the re module to:

Detect uppercase letters: r"[A-Z]"

Detect lowercase letters: r"[a-z]"

Detect digits: r"[0-9]"

Detect special characters: r"[!@#$%^&*(),.?\":{}|<>]"

🔍 Regex is a powerful tool for pattern matching and text validation.

2. How to Implement Password Validation Criteria
You learned how to:

Check if a password meets basic security standards.

Structure logic to assess each security rule separately.

Use conditions (if-else) to build a scoring system and give targeted feedback.

3. Scoring and Feedback System
You created a system that:

Scores a password from 0 to 5.

Labels it as 🔴 Weak, 🟠 Medium, 🟡 Strong, or 🟢 Very Strong.

Provides specific, user-friendly feedback on what’s missing.

🎯 This is a practical way to guide users toward creating stronger passwords.

4. Handling User Input
You learned how to:

Use input() to get user input from the terminal.

Run a script conditionally with if __name__ == "__main__": to separate logic from execution.

5. Best Practices for Secure Passwords
By implementing these checks, you’ve indirectly learned what makes a strong password:

Long enough (at least 8 characters)

A mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols

🔐 These are commonly recommended by security experts and used in real-world applications.

Learn about hashing (e.g., using hashlib) for password storage.

Add checks for common/compromised passwords using an API like "Have I Been Pwned".
